# add it to strapi / plugins package.json

# follow the strapi created tutorial to replace the wysiwyg editor but do the following:

# in ./plugins/wysiwyg/admin/src/components/CKEditor/index.js import your published editor: import Editor from 'my-custom-ckeditor/build/ckeditor'

# and enjoy adding unlimited plugins.

# this is made with the online build tools so feel free to look at it too.
